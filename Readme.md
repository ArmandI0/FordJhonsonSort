#  Ford–Johnson algorithm : 

Ford-Johnson Sort is an efficient hybrid sorting algorithm that combines principles of merge sort and insertion sort. Designed to optimize performance, this algorithm leverages the strengths of both sorting methods: the divide-and-conquer approach of merge sort and the simplicity of insertion sort for small datasets.
